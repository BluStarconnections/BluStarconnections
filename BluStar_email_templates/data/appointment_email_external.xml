                <p style="margin:0px 0 12px 0;box-sizing:border-box;">The objectives of this review will be as follows:
                    <br/>1. Analyze all costs associated with the current plan
                    <br/>2. Provide solutions to help increase plan efficiency through fee reductions and overall plan
                    design.
                    <br/>3. Ensure the plan is compliant and structured to achieve retirement goals.
                    <span><br/>Conducting a review with an independent retirement specialist, who is in no way
                        compensated by
                        your plan, is the best way to ensure fees remain the lowest possible by keeping them in line
                        with
                        the most competitive market rates currently available. Therefore, neither the retirement
                        specialist
                        conducting the review nor BluStar are affiliated with your current providers.
